### 🌱 Who am I?
Hey! I'm PC, a musician-turned-programmer on a journey to blend my love of music with the limitless world of code. 🎸💻 I come from a background of live performances and music production, but over the past few years, I've fallen in love with software development—especially artificial intelligence. Now, I spend my days coding, creating, and experimenting with AI music generation to help push the boundaries of sound.

### 👩‍💻 What I Do
By day, I’m a software engineer focusing on machine learning and music tech projects. By night, I’m probably tinkering with code to see how AI can help musicians express themselves in new, exciting ways. I'm passionate about creating tools that enhance the creative process for artists, giving them new ways to explore and produce sounds that were once only imaginable.
 
### 🔍 Interests & Passions
- **AI Music Generation** 🎹 - Building algorithms that can compose, arrange, and inspire.
- **Machine Learning** 📈 - Constantly learning, always exploring, from GANs to RNNs.
- **Creative Coding** 🎨 - Merging technology with art for unique and innovative projects.
- **Privacy-Focused Tech** 🔒 - A huge advocate for user privacy and responsible AI.

### 💡 Projects
I like to keep my projects simple and open-source (whenever possible). Some of my favorites include:
- **🎼 MelodyMind** - An AI tool that generates unique melodies based on input prompts. Designed to help musicians and producers get inspired.
- **🎸 BeatBot** - A drum generator that uses RNNs to create beats in various styles, from jazz to electronic.
- **🧩 SynthLab** - Experimenting with virtual instruments and sound synthesis powered by AI.

Feel free to explore these projects, clone them, and give feedback—I'd love to hear how others use them or what new features would be helpful!

### ⚡ Fun Facts
- I still perform live gigs from time to time—AI might generate music, but it can’t beat the real thing! 😉
- My favorite music genres are electronic, classical, and jazz.
- I’m a bit of a minimalist and like keeping things simple, so I keep my profile and repos focused and to the point.

> 👩‍💻 You won’t see much about my personal life here—I like to let my code do the talking. But if you're into AI, music, or anything in between, let’s connect and create something amazing!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! 🎶💻
